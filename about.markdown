Hello! I'm a software engineer based in Bangalore, India with a focus on frontend development. Currently, I work with Bridgestone to develop mobility solutions that improve driver safety across their US fleets.

During my free time, I'm working on Kindle2Notion, a software utility that simplifies the process of exporting Kindle notes to Notion.
