<p>We expect two sheets. One to allocate resources and the other to record transactions. Ideally we create the “Budget” sheet once in the beginning of the month and then on only make changes in the “Transactions” sheet. We expect the changes in “Transactions” sheet to automatically update the “Budget” sheet</p>
