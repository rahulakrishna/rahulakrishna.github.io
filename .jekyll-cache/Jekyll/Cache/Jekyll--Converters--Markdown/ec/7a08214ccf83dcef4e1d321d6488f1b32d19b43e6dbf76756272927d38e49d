<p>Here is what Arc Search has to say about Arc Search!</p>

<h3 id="basic-stuff-it-does">Basic Stuff it does</h3>

<hr />

<p>It does the basic stuff you expect a web browser to do. You can use it to open and browse websites and search the web.</p>

<h3 id="cool-stuff-it-does">Cool Stuff it does!</h3>

<hr />

<p>The cool stuff is the <strong>Browse for me</strong> feature.</p>

<p>This is very much like Googleâ€™s â€œfeatured snippetsâ€ but collates information from various sources</p>

<p><img src="arc-search/IMG_3803.jpeg" alt="IMG_3803.jpeg" /></p>

<p>Here Google shows the answer and source</p>

<p>Whereas Arc:</p>

<p><img src="arc-search/IMG_3804.png" alt="IMG_3804.png" /></p>

<p><img src="arc-search/IMG_3805.png" alt="IMG_3805.png" /></p>

<p>This is data from multiple sources. Now one useful thing you can do with Google is where you add the keyword â€œredditâ€ to the search query to find a thread that may contain deeper discussion or specific answer. So you can ask Arc Search:</p>

<p><img src="arc-search/IMG_3806.png" alt="IMG_3806.png" /></p>

<p><img src="arc-search/IMG_3807.png" alt="IMG_3807.png" /></p>

<p><img src="arc-search/IMG_3808.png" alt="IMG_3808.png" /></p>

<p>Iâ€™ve found asking what Reddit, Twitter or Hacker News thinks about specific topics and gotten interesting results. Just the contrast in what the user bases talk about is interesting.</p>

<p>Consider yourself in a bookstore. Using Arc to search â€œwhat does reddit think about Radical Candorâ€ is much simpler and faster than searching Google â€œRadical Candor redditâ€.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It does display the sources for your data. But itâ€™s AI and AI gets it wrong at times.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="arc-search/Untitled.jpeg" alt="Untitled" /></p>

<p>All other data on the page is impressive.</p>

<p>All the text in this page is right about me. But the person shown in the picture is not me. Thatâ€™s another person who has the same name as me</p>

<p><img src="arc-search/Untitled%201.jpeg" alt="Untitled" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Less prominence to sources.
Look at the sunscreen related screenshots in this page. It shows you where it sources the data from. In a tiny text below the blocks. Thereâ€™s also a list of links if youâ€™re interested in learning more. But the UI is trying to hiny that thereâ€™s enough data here that you donâ€™t need to click through those links. Iâ€™m not sure how you can solve this problem or even if this is a problem.
They probably donâ€™t want to replace Google Search. Where you are presented with titles and content hidden behind links.
