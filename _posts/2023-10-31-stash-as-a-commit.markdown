# Stash as a Commit

Date: October 31, 2023

### What is a Stash?

---

From Julia Evans‚Äô blog article titled **Some miscellaneous git facts**

> üëâüèΩ \***\*the stash is a bunch of commits\*\***
>
> When I run¬†`git stash`¬†to stash my changes, I‚Äôve always been a bit confused about where those changes actually went. It turns out that when you run¬†`git stash`, git makes some commits with your changes and labels them with a reference called¬†`stash`¬†(in¬†`.git/refs/stash`).
>
> Let‚Äôs stash this blog post and look at the log of the¬†`stash`¬†reference:
>
> ```
> $ git log stash --oneline
> 6cb983fe (refs/stash) WIP on main: c6ee55ed wip
> 2ff2c273 index on main: c6ee55ed wip
> ... some more stuff
>
> ```
>
> Now we can look at the commit¬†`2ff2c273`¬†to see what it contains:
>
> ```
> $ git show 2ff2c273  --stat
> commit 2ff2c273357c94a0087104f776a8dd28ee467769

> `git stash`¬†actually creates 2 separate commits: one for the index, and one for your changes that you haven‚Äôt staged yet. I found this kind of heartening because I‚Äôve been working on a tool to snapshot and restore the state of a git repository (that I may or may not ever release) and I came up with a very similar design, so that made me feel better about my choices.

### Why can‚Äôt we just commit instead of stashing?

---

For those used to the idea of git from command line, this may seem like a strange idea. But if your git workflow is well integrated into your IDE (I must admit, I have only VS Code in mind here), then this is such a good idea.

#### The Atom UI

I absolutely adored the Atom UI. The best part to me was the three pane design that put File Explorer, Code and Git in view always.

This is good because as you went making changes in files, it kept adding a list item in the right side of the screen and you had a general idea how big your changes were becoming. Putting this upfront meant a little extra motivation to go and make experimental changes anywhere which never left your view and you could just go and cherry-pick or discard everything!

### The Flow in Atom

---

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre in `feature-branch-1` and you need to switch branches to `master`. Naturally, you‚Äôll stash your changes in `feature-branch-1`

Here‚Äôs the alternative commit method in Atom.

### What about VS Code?

---

VS Code doesn‚Äôt come with the same layout by default. It‚Äôs for the better and you can have the same Atom-like workflow in VS Code. Just enable a Secondary Side Bar and drag your ‚ÄúSource Control‚Äù and ‚ÄúCommits‚Äù to the second pane.

A lot more cluttered than my Atom. But it also does a lot more than Atom!

### The Same Flow in VS Code

### The Advantage

---

The real advantage is that a stash commit is local to a branch. This is ideal if you‚Äôre often working on multiple features and need to stash something to switch branches (often to master to create a new branch). So when you come back you see the stash commit and you‚Äôre back where you left it. Sometimes, when a week later when you revisit a branch, remembering that you stashed some code is not clear.

### The case for stash

---

- `git stash` actually frees your branch of changes for use at a later time. Which is necessary if you don‚Äôt have a branch to do a `stash commit`.
- If you have a piece of code that you often need, but can‚Äôt commit. `git stash` is the way to go.
