My friend Nami send me this Instagram Reel about a concept called The Wednesday Waffle. I found the whole concept intriguing. Sort of like a weekly accountability meeting — with friends. 

I missed the first one due to my best friend’s wedding. However, I did send her an update as soon as I could. As of writing this, the next update is due tomorrow. 

I haven’t done much this week. But I’m hoping that having this ritual in the back of my mind is going to make me more productive, connected and content in life.
