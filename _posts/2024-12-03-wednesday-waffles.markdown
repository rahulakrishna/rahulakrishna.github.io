My friend Nami send me this Instagram Reel about a concept called The Wednesday Waffle. I found the whole concept intriguing. Sort of like a weekly accountability update — with friends. 

I missed the first one due to my best friend’s wedding. However, I did send her an update as soon as I could. As of writing this, the next update is due tomorrow. 

I haven’t done much this week. But I’m hoping that having this ritual in the back of my mind is going to make me more productive, connected and content in life.

### Process

---

You record a short video where you talk about the past week. **These shouldn’t be shared in a group. These are personal videos intended to be sent to one person.** There’s no specified time limit or guidelines — but my intention is to keep it as short as possible. 

My plan is to divide it into three sections as of now

1. Life Updates
2. Books or Media consumed in the last week
3. Plans for the upcoming week
