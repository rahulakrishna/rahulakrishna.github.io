# ⛰ What It's About

---

A coming-of-age story set in 1960s Japan, narrated by Toru Watanabe, a college student who reflects on his past, particularly his relationships with two women: Naoko and Midori. The novel explores themes of love, loss, memory, and mental health, set against the backdrop of political unrest and youth culture in postwar Japan.

# 🔍 How I Discovered It

---

Multiple sources recommended the book to me. My friend Mazin had recommended it back in 2020. A girlfriend had recommended it again in 2021. A very good Reddit friend in 2024 finally made me give up my reservations and try it. 

# 🧠 Thoughts

Loved it. The book has a matter-of-fact voice like that of a scientific journal. Murakami intends to re-kindle the pain or experience of the primary themes of the book of love, loss, memory and mental health instead of bringing a brand new experience to readers. That makes this book personal for its readers

## What I Liked About It

I liked the writing style of Murakami. It’s vert matter-of-factly. Doesn’t use *intensifiers* in his writing. Bringing such technical writing to matters of love, death and sex is interesting. Authors are usually careful approaching the subject of sex in their books. Murakami’s treatment of sex as if in a scientific journal is unique. A kiss is two lips caressing each other. An orgasm is the process of getting rid of cum. The bold explorations of loss and love is what makes this book universally loved. 

## What I Didn't Like About It

There’s some general hate in the wild west of Internet about Murakami’s treatment of women. 

# 🥰 Who Would Like It?

Anyone who has experienced intense feelings of love, loss, memory and mental health!
