### The Side Project Hustle

---

This post is heavily inspired by [Garrit's blog post](https://garrit.xyz/posts/2024-12-29-2024-in-review?utm_source=rss)

Garrit wants to build a side project that generates x amount in revenue. I want to build a side project that at least 10 people find useful. Apart from work, the projects that I've contributed to that people have found useful are majestic and kindle2notion. My own variant of kindle2notion that was built on nextjs with a decent ui leaves far more to be desired. In 2025, I want to either contribute seriously to some existing open source project, or build one on my own

### The 10km run

Copied from Garrit's 2024 goals. My friend [Sharat Oommen](https://x.com/sharathey94) recently ran 10k at The Chennai Marathon. I want to participate in a marathon first and then run one seriously. I plan to follow [ExRx's 19 week marathon program](https://exrx.net/Aerobic/MarathonProgram)


### Buy a car

2025 is the year I'll be buying my first car. I'll need to sort out the financials. Plan is to get a Honda City in March

### Publish 20 Blog Posts

I've found writing in public to be an exercise that makes me feel productive. Making this a regular occurence and publishing at the rate of ~2 blog posts per month sounds like something that will benefit my personal and professional life
