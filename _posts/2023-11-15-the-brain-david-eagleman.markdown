1. Consciousness. It's a good thing that most of the things we do day-to-day are unconscious actions. However, we can cater to a different us in the future and make it impossibly obvious for that person. The idea aligns well with other productivity books like Atomic Habits and Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking

# üöÄ The Book in 3 Sentences

---

1. Explores the philosophical and biological aspects of the brain and the whole idea of consciousness
2. Explores "reality" and how we can have different versions of reality
3. Explores how consciousness has very little effect on most day to day activities conducted by the brain

# üé® Impressions

---

Very intriguing. Eagleman is a neuroscientist and has seen his fair share of the quirky brain-related issues in his time.

## How I Discovered It

A PhD student, who went on to finish her doctorate in the medical field, suggested this book to me while I discussed Why We Sleep with her

## Who Should Read It?

Maybe you don't need this book if you're already a neuroscientist. But the overwhelmingly abundant reviews this book garnered from the scientific community claims that Eagleman simplifies complicated neuroscientific concepts for the layperson and if you're interested in that then you should read this book.

# ‚òòÔ∏è How the Book Changed Me

üí° How my life / behaviour / thoughts / ideas have changed as a result of reading the book.

</aside>

- Understanding consciousness as a CEO of our brain is honestly life changing. We often think that everything we do is the result of our thought process, but in reality, it is not. Consciousness initiates a thought. What happens to it is not much in our control, this is very interesting. Eagleman does go into ways of using our consciousness to influence unconscious actions, which I found very powerful. Henceforth, I will appreciate and be more aware of the unconscious actions that I commit every day, like picking up a coffee mug or just lying down on a couch. And try to use these autopilot mechanisms to my advantage.
- Understanding reality as being unique to everyone is huge (Also very close to the Indian spiritual idea of _Maya_, where everything is considered an illusion). It encourages you to become more aware of how others are feeling and cater to their reality because what they see from their shoes through their eyes is completely different from what you see.

# ‚úçÔ∏è My Top 4 Quotes

---

1. What if I told you that the world around you, with its rich colors, textures, sounds, and scents is an illusion, a show put on for you by your brain? If you could perceive reality as it is, you would be shocked by its colorless, odorless, tasteless silence. Outside your brain, there is just energy and matter.
2. So not only was it possible to implant false new memories in the brain, but people embraced and embellished them, unknowingly weaving fantasy into the fabric of their identity.
3. So who you are at any given moment depends on the detailed rhythms of your neuronal firing. During the day, the conscious you emerges from that integrated neural complexity. At night, when the interaction of your neurons changes just a bit, you disappear. Your loved ones have to wait until the next morning, when your neurons let the wave die and work themselves back into their complex rhythm. Only then do you return.
4. You might assume that you end at the border of your skin, but there‚Äôs a sense in which there‚Äôs no way to mark the end of you and the beginning of all those around you.
