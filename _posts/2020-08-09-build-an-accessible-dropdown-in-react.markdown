#### The problem with Dropdowns

1. People use them in a certain way and build them in that way.
2. There's huge limitations to customising dropdowns

### The default HTML way of creating a dropdown

#### Code

```
<select>
  <option>First Option</option>
  <option>Second Option</option>
</select>
```

#### Result

##### We need to create a codepen/codesandbox where all the mouse events are captured and logged
