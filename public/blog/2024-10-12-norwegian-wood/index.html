<p>Loved it. The book has a matter-of-fact voice like that of a scientific journal. Murakami intends to re-kindle the pain or experience of the primary themes of the book of love, loss, memory and mental health instead of bringing a brand new experience to readers. That makes this book personal for its readers</p>

<p>I liked the writing style of Murakami. It‚Äôs vert matter-of-factly. Doesn‚Äôt use <em>intensifiers</em> in his writing. Bringing such technical writing to matters of love, death and sex is interesting. Authors are usually careful approaching the subject of sex in their books. Murakami‚Äôs treatment of sex as if in a scientific journal is unique. A kiss is two lips caressing each other. An orgasm is the process of getting rid of cum. The bold explorations of loss and love is what makes this book universally loved.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs some general hate in the wild west of Internet about Murakami‚Äôs treatment of women.</p>
