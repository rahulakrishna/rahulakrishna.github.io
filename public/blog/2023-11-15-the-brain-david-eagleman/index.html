The concept of consciousness: The majority of our daily activities are conducted unconsciously, which is beneficial. However, we can strategically plan for our future selves and make our intentions exceedingly clear. This concept aligns with productivity literature such as Atomic Habits and Allen Carr&rsquo;s Easy Way to Stop Smoking.

<p>While neuroscientists may already be familiar with the concepts presented, the book has received high praise from the scientific community for Eagleman&rsquo;s ability to simplify complex neuroscientific concepts for the general reader. If you have an interest in neuroscience, this book is recommended.</p>

üí° How my life / behaviour / thoughts / ideas have changed as a result of reading the book.
</aside>
<ul>
<li>The book&rsquo;s portrayal of consciousness as the CEO of our brain has had a profound impact on me. We often believe that our actions are the result of our thought processes, but this is not always the case. Consciousness initiates a thought, but its subsequent journey is largely out of our control. This concept is fascinating. Eagleman provides strategies for using our consciousness to influence unconscious actions, which I found to be a powerful tool. Moving forward, I will strive to be more aware of the unconscious actions I perform daily, such as picking up a coffee mug or reclining on a couch, and attempt to leverage these autopilot mechanisms to my advantage.</li>
<li>The idea that reality is unique to each individual is significant (this aligns closely with the Indian spiritual concept of Maya, where everything is considered an illusion). This understanding encourages greater empathy and consideration for others&rsquo; perspectives, as their perception of reality, viewed through their unique lens, differs from our own.</li>

<li>What if I told you that the world around you, with its rich colors, textures, sounds, and scents is an illusion, a show put on for you by your brain? If you could perceive reality as it is, you would be shocked by its colorless, odorless, tasteless silence. Outside your brain, there is just energy and matter.</li>
<li>So not only was it possible to implant false new memories in the brain, but people embraced and embellished them, unknowingly weaving fantasy into the fabric of their identity.</li>
<li>So who you are at any given moment depends on the detailed rhythms of your neuronal firing. During the day, the conscious you emerges from that integrated neural complexity. At night, when the interaction of your neurons changes just a bit, you disappear. Your loved ones have to wait until the next morning, when your neurons let the wave die and work themselves back into their complex rhythm. Only then do you return.</li>
<li>You might assume that you end at the border of your skin, but there‚Äôs a sense in which there‚Äôs no way to mark the end of you and the beginning of all those around you.</li>
